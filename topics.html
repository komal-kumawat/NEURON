                <p class="paragraph">"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea
                    of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of
                    the system,and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
                    master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects,dislikes,or avoids pleasure itself,because
                    it is pleasure,but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
                    consequences that are extremely painful.Nor again is there anyonewho loves or pursues or desires to
                    obtain pain itself, because it is pain, but because occassionally circumstances occur
                    in which toil and pain can prcure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example
                    , which of us ever undertakes laborius physical exercise, except to obtain
                    some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
                    chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences"

                    improve from
                    experience without being explicitly programmed. Central to its functionality is data, which provides
                    the
                    foundation for algorithms to identify patterns and make informed decisions. These algorithms
                    leverage
                    features, the measurable properties of data, to predict labels or targets in supervised learning
                    tasks.
                    Models, mathematical representations of data relationships, are trained on datasets to optimize
                    parameters for accurate predictions. To assess performance, data is split into training and testing
                    sets, ensuring models generalize well to new data and avoid overfitting. With supervised,
                    unsupervised,
                    and reinforcement learning techniques, machine learning finds applications in diverse fields like
                    healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles, shaping our increasingly data-driven world.</p>
